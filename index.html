    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>and the wind howled and groaned with a low growl.</p>
    <p>A figure begins to emerge from the darkness.</p>
    <p>Dressed head to toe in black clothing, this being had a fell look about it.</p>
    <p>While staring straight through you it reaches out an open hand.</p>
